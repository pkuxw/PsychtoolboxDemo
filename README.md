# PTBdemo
This is Peter Scarfe's psychtoolbox demo for beginners.

The aim of these demos is to provide an introduction to how to program using Psychtoolbox (PTB). To get started you will need to have installed Matlab or Octave (a free version of Matlab) and followed the install instructions which are provided on the PTB website. If you have previously installed PTB I recommend you use the "UpdatePsychtoolbox" command to get the latest version. 

There are around 40 demos on this site and these are organised into sections based on learning different aspects of PTB. For all users I strongly suggest looking at sections (1) and (2) as these show essential features which will help get you up to speed coding in Matlab and PTB. If you are not clear on the essentials, you will struggle with the more difficult aspects. 

Please make sure you carefully read the comments in the code as these provide an explanation of why things are done the way they are.
The demos provided as an educational resource. I provide no guarantees that the demos provide "best practice" for your specific needs. 

PTB has an active forum which can be found here. If you have problems with core PTB functionality ask questions there. PTB is now primary developed for Linux, reduced functionality and support is provided for Windows and OSX, so one would need to bear this in mind when interpreting any response.
